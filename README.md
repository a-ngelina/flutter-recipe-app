# flutter-recipe-app
A flutter app for linux to type in and view recipes
---
The home page:

![home-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ef319-2d5a-4299-8384-b50224e16e6e)

Type in your recipe with a prefered number of ingredients and preparation steps in the "new recipe" directory. Click the save button to store the result, otherwise it'll be lost if you go to another directory ("home page" or "browse recipes"):

![new-recipe-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2af10a51-b229-4eca-85ef-d72e907be09f)

View the recipes you've typed in in the "browse recipes" directory:

![stored-recipes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/568c7dc8-9ae8-466e-b332-5a2395f61772)

Click the arrows to see a detailed recipe. Check the boxes with the ingredients you have to conviniently see what's missing:

![detailed-recipe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77ff71aa-fc66-4b13-9882-e806361c549e)

To make the app more convinient:
 - use a database to store the recipes
 - make a recipe search
 - add tags to find a dish that would suit one's current needs
 - add photos to the recipes
